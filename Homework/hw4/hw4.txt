CS161 Homework 4 
Winter 20

The graph from graph1.txt is unsatisfiable with 3 colors. 
The graph is satiable with 4 colors.

This is because the highest degree node has a degree of 4. Using the colors red, green, blue, and yellow, a solution can be defined as follows:

four colors: RED, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE. 

Color Node 1 RED.
Color Node 2 YELLOW.
Color Node 5 GREEN.
Color Node 6 BLUE.
Color Node 7 GREEN. 
Color Node 3 RED. 
Color Node 4 YELLOW. 


The graph extracted from graph2.txt is much more massive. 
It requires 8 more or colors to be a satisfiable instance.
